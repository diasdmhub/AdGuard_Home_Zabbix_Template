### OVERVIEW

[AdGuard Home](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome) is a network-wide ad blocking and tracking software. Once you've set it up, it will cover your devices without the need for any client-side software.

If you want to monitor your AdGuard Home instance with Zabbix, this template provides some useful monitoring items. \
The monitoring is done via "REST-ish" API as [AdGuard Home offers an OpenAPI specification](https://github.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/tree/master/openapi).

The main focus is on monitoring statistics from AdGuard Home.

### TEMPLATES

For more flexibility, the release includes templates that cover **two monitoring methods**, one for native HTTP data retrieval and another for Zabbix Agent Active. Both methods provide the same monitoring items, but with different item types. **They are not intended to be used together on the same host**.

There are also **two independent template types**. One is for HTTP AdGuard Home general **status and statistics**, and the other is for **filter parameters** discovery. \
In total, the released `yaml` file contains **four** templates.

- `AdGuard Home Stats by HTTP`
- `AdGuard Home Stats by Zabbix Agent Active`
- `AdGuard Home Filters by HTTP`
- `AdGuard Home Filters by Zabbix Agent Active`

<BR>


### REQUIREMENTS

- AdGuard Home
  - Zabbix Agent required only for active monitoring
  > - _**The template uses the `system.run[*]` key for active monitoring with the Zabbix Agent. [The `AllowKey=system.run[*]` parameter](https://www.zabbix.com/documentation/current/en/manual/config/items/restrict_checks) must be enabled to allow the agent to collect data locally.**_
  > - _**Accordingly, AdGuard Home must allow requests from itself when using an active Zabbix Agent.**_

### TESTED VERSION

This template has been tested with AdGuard Home version `> 0.107` on an Asus RT-AX86U router running an [Asus Merlin](https://www.asuswrt-merlin.net) firmware, a Mikrotik RouterOS and a standard Linux distribution running Oracle Linux 9. It should work with any recent version of AdGuard Home.

<BR>


### SETUP

> **If the AdGuard Home web user is password protected, the client must use an authentication mechanism when sending requests to the server. Basic access authentication is the offered method. A client must include an `Authorization` HTTP header along with all requests:**
> ```
> Authorization: Basic BASE64_DATA
> ```
> **Where *`BASE64_DATA`* is a base64-encoded data for your *`username:password`* string.**

<BR>

---
1️⃣ After importing the template to Zabbix and creating AdGuard's host, encode **your** AdGuard Authorization string `username:password` to Base64. See the examples bellow.
  - Shell
> ```shell
> echo -n 'username:password' | base64
> ```

  - Python
> ```python
> import base64
> string = 'username:password'
> base64.b64encode(bytes(string, 'utf-8'))
> ```

  - PowerShell
> ```pwsh
> $string = 'username:password'
> [Convert]::ToBase64String([System.Text.Encoding]::UTF8.GetBytes($string))
> ```

<BR>

2️⃣ Copy and paste the encoded string into your host's macro `{$ADGUARD.AUTH}`.
